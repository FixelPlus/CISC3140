# README


##This file contains all commands used to create a make file

`touch Makefile`: creates an emply file that will be used for automation further

`make`: runs previously created makefile (will not produce any output if called again without changes to the makefile)

`make clean`: removes all files specified in the makefile under `clean` rule. In my case it will remove all fieles with ".o" extention.

`./ target name` : will execute the output that was scpecified in the code.
